The difference between divs, classes, ids and spans is that, ids are the "identification labels" of a html, and the should be different for every single div that is presented within the html. Classes group similar types of elements together based on style and things like that, given what is presented in the id. Divs provide structure within the html without having to necessarily classifying specific styles and content. and spans require important organization, and also serve as an identifier within the div. There can be multiple spans within one div.

I would say my biggest challenge this week has been figuring out how to embed images into atom. I am still struggling with this, however, I watched some vidoes about how to do this and am starting to figure it out more and more each week.
