Neither <head> or <body> should be used more than once in a page. It is important
keep all of the information of the page within these two elements. The <head> element
gives insight to all the information relating to the page, and the <head> tag
defines the content within the page.

Structural markup paves way for the page layout and structure of the actual page,
whereas semantic markup dives deeper into the details of whats going on the page,
such as sentences, grammar, etc.

My work cycle for this assignment was pretty organized. I looked at examples and made
sure that I was understanding my work as I was going. THis class is definitely
tricky, but I am proud of myself because I do feel as though I am learning
more and more about the processes behind a website, and I have a new profound
respect for coding and the people who code websites.
