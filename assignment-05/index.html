The story starts out with two children stuck inside on a cold rainy day.
the kids sit and wait, and think upon their boredum, when all of the sudden,
comes in Cat in the Hat! He greets them with questions about why they are sitting
and doing nothing, he proposes that they make the best out of their day.

The kids fish became suspicious of this cats behavior, and told the kids not to
engage with the cat in the hat. The cat proposes a game idea that involves said
fish and the fish does not approve, so cat in the hat proceeds to try and impress the
fish with all of his amazing tricks. However, the fish is still very unimpressed
as the cat makes an absolute disaster of the house.

After the mess has been made and the kids and the fish are dismayed, the cat brings
in a little red box, that he opens and two "things" pop out. The boy spots his mother
out the window, and everyone begins to panic, except for the cat in the Hat
he leaves momentarily and comes back in the house with a machine that begins
cleansing the big mess that he made. The fish and the two kids sit there in
excitement as they watch the Cat in the Hat work away at the house. The cat
in the hat manages to make the house spotless just in time for the mother to come
home and for the cat to get away without the mother sighting him.

The story ends with the mother coming back and the children and fish are exactly
where they were sitting when the story began. The mother asks what the children
did when she was away, and none of them can give her an answer to her question.
